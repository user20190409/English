Going on Study or Going to Work

Currently, the major dilemma which most students face upon graduation is whether to continue pursuing postgraduate studies or to find a job immediately. 
Those who decide to go to work immediately cannot wait to put what they have learned into practice.
They believe that only by application can they master knowledge in the real sense. 
Most important of all, they can live on their own and have the feeling of accomplishment for the first time. 
Other people, however, believe that if a person wants to be an expert in a specialized field, four years in university is far from enough. 
The best way is to choose a direction and study it in depth. 
It is not late at all when they go to work, because they start at a much higher level. 
No matter which choice a student will finally make, he has to be extremely careful to look into his unique situation and consult the predecessors for their advice. 
He will make the right choice if he knows his goal in life and how to turn it into reality.
